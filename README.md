Currently I am working as a Software Engineer Intern at Bayer 🏛️

Programming Languages I have experience with:
  - Python 🐍
  - Javascript 📜
  - Java ☕
  - C 🗝️

I have used before:
  - cdk and terraform to create code as infrastructure for AWS 🏗️
  - Python in combination with gunicorn, uvicorn, flask and fastapi 🦄
  - RestAPI's ⬆️
  - Node.js 
  - React and redux
  - git (more gitlab than github) 🔄
  - gitrunner 🏃
  - jira 🎫
  - docker 🐳

I switched from Technical Engineering ➡️ Media Informatics </br>
since I am not a fan of math without numbers 😉

🌄 Always looking forward to learn new stuff
